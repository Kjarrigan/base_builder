= Working Title: Base Builder

Inspired by the Youtube-Series from @quill18 (Project Porcupine) I'll try to implement a "base builder" in 
Ruby with Gosu as Backend. As I haven't done any "big" game so far I hope to get a feeling which Gosu.issues
should be "solved" first and I might test some stuff 'Im working on for the Gosu project so don't expect that
this runs with the latest stable or even master-branch of http://github.om/gosu/gosu

Thanks @quill18(creates) for your great content. It's a joy watching your videos and even if I don't use 
Unity or C# there are quite some well explained concept I can adapt for my purposes.

Thanks @jlnr for Gosu
