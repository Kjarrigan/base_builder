# TODO

## Next Session

* Add wall-building with connected textures

## Somewhat "short-term"

* move some methods to get seperate classes/modules for visuals, logic, objectmanagement and sound
* move the code to seperate files

## Known Bugs

* If you drag upwards/left the "last" tile flickers.
  my guess: the swap in Map.tiles_between
